# Contributing to EUC Samples from GitHub Desktop for macOS #

## Prerequisites for Contributing ##
1. Create your own [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) & sign in 
2. Download [Github Desktop for macOS](https://desktop.github.com) and install it by copying the `GitHub Desktop.app` to your `/Applications` folder
3. On first launch, sign in to GitHub Desktop with your GitHub credentials and complete the first-run screens.

## Cloning the EUC-Samples Repository ## 
1. Open [EUC-Samples](https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples) in Safari.   Click the green button to *Clone or Download* and copy the *Clone with HTTPS* URL.

> Note:  If you click *Open in Desktop*, you may get redirected to the GitHub Desktop download site if you're not logged in on both Safari and GitHub Desktop

2. In GitHub Desktop, click *Clone a Repository from the Internet* in the wizard (or click **File > Clone Repository**).  
3. Choose the URL tab and paste the link copied in step 1.
4. Select the Local Path to store your copy of the repository, and click *Clone*
5. When the clone completes, GitHub Desktop displays the repository and *master* branch 

> Some of the samples in the EUC-Samples repository are large.  Depending on your Internet connection speed and hard disk speed, it may take a while to clone the repository locally.  

## Creating your own working Branch ##
The best practice for contributing is to create your own branch within the repository and add your work there.  You then use this branch as a staging area to send pull requests to the main branch in order to request your changes be merged for everyone to see.

1. Click the heading that says *Current Branch **master***
2. Click the *New Branch* button
3. Enter a name for your branch and click *Create Branch*
4. Click *Publish Branch* in the main area

> Note that GitHub Desktop changes your "Current Branch" to show *Current Branch **YourBranchName***

5. Start making changes to the files you downloaded to your local path.
