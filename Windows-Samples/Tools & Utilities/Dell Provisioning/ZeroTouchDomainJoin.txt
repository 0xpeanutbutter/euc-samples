## Overview

- **Supported Platforms**: Workspace ONE 1811 or newer
- **Tested on**: Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise 1803+

## Purpose
When selecting the "On-Premesis Active Directory Join", the system automatically logs into the local administrator account to facilitate Workspace ONE staged enrollment. Today, once staged enrollment is complete the system will land on the administrator desktop and will require a manual reboot/log out. Adding this command will automatically reboot the computer once Workspace ONE staged enrollment is completed, thus eliminating the manual step.

## Description 
This needs to be added to the "First Logon Commands" sections of the Configurations page (unattend xml) in the Workspace ONE console. 

## Command
powershell while(-not $completed){if((get-itemproperty -path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\AIRWATCH\EnrollmentStatus).status -eq 'Completed'){$Completed = $true; shutdown /r /t 0}else{start-sleep 3}}
